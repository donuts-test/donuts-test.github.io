## Usage

This website makes use of the static website generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Petridish](https://github.com/peterdesmet/petridish) theme. **Each commit to `main` will automatically trigger a new build on GitHub Pages.** There is no need to build the site locally, but you can by installing Jekyll and running `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

Minor changes can be committed directly to `main`.

Changes requiring review (e.g. new blog posts) should be created in a separate branch and submitted as a pull request. Some guidelines:
