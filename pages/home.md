## Who are we?
DONUTS Collaboratory is a research collective. Co-founded by three faculty in Drexel University's Information Science Department, we adopt values-centered, data-driven, and language-driven approaches to understanding a fundamental set of sociotechnical problems. Namely, what it means to be human beings -- people -- deserving of agency, safety, and dignity in an era characterized by rapid and large-scale technological change. Our work is dedicated to understanding the short- and long-term impacts that digital cultures have on people's everyday lives. We do work in applied areas like privacy, safety, and AI. We also do work in theoretical areas like ontology and textuality. But more than merely understanding the problems we study, we are motivated by a desire to leave this place -- our shared world -- a little better than we found it.
